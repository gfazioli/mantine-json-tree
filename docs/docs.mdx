import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree/styles.css';
```

You can import styles within a layer `@layer mantine-json-tree` by importing `@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree/styles.layer.css` file.

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree/styles.layer.css';
```

## Usage

> **Note:**
> The `JsonTree` component renders only on the client side to avoid hydration mismatches in SSR (Server-Side Rendering) environments. This is necessary because the SVG coordinates are calculated with floating-point math, which can differ between server and client. If you use SSR, the json-tree will appear only after the client has mounted.

The `JsonTree` enables the creation of a captivating json-tree effect, which enhances the visual dynamics of a user interface. This effect can be used to draw attention, indicate loading processes, or provide an interactive experience that engages users effectively. By implementing this json-tree effect, developers can improve the overall aesthetic appeal and functionality of their applications, ensuring a more seamless and enjoyable user experience.

<Demo data={demos.configurator} />

## Styled

Of course, you can style the json-tree as you like. For example, by adding an additional animation effect on the whole json-tree.

<Demo data={demos.styled} />

## Example: Random

Random json-tree effect. Use it to create a loading effect.

<Demo data={demos.random} />
